== DESCRIPTION:

A pure-ruby growl notifier.  ruby-growl allows you to perform Growl
notification via UDP from machines without growl installed (for example,
non-OSX machines).

What's Growl?  Growl is a really cool "global notification system for Mac OS
X".  See http://growl.info/

See also the Ruby Growl bindings in Growl's subversion repository:
http://growl.info/documentation/growl-source-install.php

ruby-growl also contains a command-line notification tool named 'growl'.  Where
possible, it isoption-compatible with growlnotify.  (Use --priority instead of
-p.)

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Requires "Listen for incoming notifications" enabled

== INSTALL:

  gem install ruby-growl
